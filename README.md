*Transformations performed to clean up the data

In the run_analysis.R the first step is to set up the environment including the pagecages needed and the directory where the data is saved

The second step is to load the test and training datasets, including the
subject, and activity datasets and merge all of them together

The third step is to add column names using the features dataset and extract only the mean and standard deviation columns of the measurements

The fourth step is to use descriptive activity names to name the activities and create tidy dataset

The fifth step is to create a txt file of the tidyData
